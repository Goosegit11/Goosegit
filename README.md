# Goosegit

Hello! I am Goosegit.

I am learning GNU/Linux and system administration, and some other nerd stuff.

I use Arch Linux with dwm as my window manager, therefore I have to tinker a lot with my system.

Currently you can't find me anywhere.   
If you really want to contact me, then do it through Github (by making a pull request in this repo or whatever).
